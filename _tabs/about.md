>I am a doctoral student at The Royal institute of technology (KTH) Sweden, specializes in perception systems and social artificial intelligence. My current research includes developing systems that are capable of detecting and classifying internal states (e.g. frustration, stress) using facial thermal signature and visual social cues. I have a masters degree in Robotics from the University of Bristol, UK of which i also worked on social robotics and developed a system that is able to detect if a person is being interactive within a group, by using the social signals of the surrounding group members.
