>After completing my PhD last year at The Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden, where I dove deep into perception systems and social artificial intelligence, I've transitioned from academic research to building the future of AI. My doctoral work was all about teaching machines to understand human emotions—developing cutting-edge systems that can detect and classify internal states like frustration and stress by analyzing facial thermal signatures and visual social cues. It was fascinating work that opened my eyes to the incredible potential of AI to understand human behavior.

>Today, I'm channeling that passion into entrepreneurship. I'm the founder of three AI-focused startups, each pushing the boundaries of what's possible. One of them, Pokamind, directly builds on my PhD research, transforming those years of academic exploration into real-world applications that can make a difference. My journey started with a master's degree in Robotics from the University of Bristol, UK, where I first fell in love with social robotics—developing a system that could detect group interactivity by reading the subtle social signals between people. That early work laid the foundation for everything that followed, from my PhD research to the startups I'm building today.
