My main contribution for HRI2022 Conference is my paper [Automatic Frustration Detection Using Thermal Imaging](/assets/docs/HRI2022.pdf) which is published in the proceedings of the conference.  

Here is the abstract of the paper:
> To achieve seamless interactions, robots have to be capable of reliably detecting affective states in real time. One of the possible states that humans go through while interacting with robots is frustration. Detecting frustration from RGB images can be challenging in some real-world situations; thus, we investigate in this work whether thermal imaging can be used to create a model that is capable of detecting frustration induced by cognitive load and failure. To train our model, we collected a data set from 18 participants experiencing both types of frustration induced by a robot. The model was tested using features from several modalities: thermal, RGB, Electrodermal Activity (EDA), and all three combined. When data from both frustration cases were combined and used as training input, the model reached an accuracy of 89% with just RGB features, 87% using only thermal features, 84% using EDA, and 86% when using all modalities. Furthermore, the highest accuracy for the thermal data was reached using three facial regions of interest: nose, forehead and lower lip.

Unfortunately, the conference is virtual but i will be attending the european meetup in barcelona.
the post will be updated with other contributions in the conference, and some future work that will be submitted in some the of conference workshops.
